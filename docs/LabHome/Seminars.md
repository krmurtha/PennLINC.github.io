# Seminars and Talks at Penn

There is a sometimes bewildering array of relevant seminar series relevant to neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychiatry, and development.

We try to integrate these in a unified PennLINC google calender. This is currently maintained by Sophia Linguiti, please contact her for access to this calendar if you are a member of PennLINC. The calendar is also mirrored for public viewing on the pennlinc.io frontpage (scroll to the bottom).

Several of the main seminar series are listed below:


### MINS

### MindCORE

### LiBI

### CBICA
