# Project Meetings with Ted

All PennLINC team members are expected to lead a scientific project.  

## Scheduling

For each of these projects, members typically meet weekly with Ted. However, if there has been limited progress due to other competing demands, meetings can be spaced to every other week (send Ted a brief note). In general, we try to avoid scheduling meetings without a clear agenda. These are scheduled by the trainee on a google calendar, which Ted will give you access to, and permissions to create events. Each week, Ted will open up slots marked “OPEN FOR MEETINGS” on this calendar; a note will be posted to the #WhereAmI channel on Slack when these meeting times are posted. Typically, meetings are 30 minutes, except in specific cases when a 45-minute or 60-minute meeting is necessary (please discuss prospectively).

### Secondary mentor

For projects led by junior trainees (i.e., CRCs, new data analysts, and rotating graduate students), Ted will identify a more-experienced team member (i.e., senior grad student, post-doc, or staff scientist) as a secondary/mid-level mentor. This is critical, as the secondary mentor tends to be both a) more available and b) more technically skilled. The junior trainee should schedule separate 1:1 meetings with the secondary mentor at least once a week, or as needed, in addition to the weekly meeting with Ted. The secondary mentor is usually the second author on the paper, and serves as the “replication buddy” (see [project reproducibility guide]( https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/LabHome/ReproSystem/)).

### Preparation

For these meetings, please update the project trello board ahead of the meeting so project progress can be clearly tracked. My preference is that data at these meetings is presented in the form of RMarkdown or Juypter notebooks to enhance reproducibility, although images attached to trello or powerpoint slide decks are acceptable as well. Please keep all markdown/notebook PDFs and slide decks reviewed in the weekly meeting in a clearly labeled folder in the shared google drive
